## Cline AI stock predictor
"Create a Python-based AI stock price predictor that:
- Uses machine learning to forecast stock prices
- Incorporates multiple data sources (historical prices, financial news, market sentiment)
- Implements advanced predictive models like LSTM or transformer-based networks
- Includes risk assessment and prediction confidence metrics

Technical specifications:
- Language: Python
- Key Libraries: 
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for model evaluation
  - yfinance for financial data retrieval
  - NLTK or TextBlob for sentiment analysis

Implementation details:
- Use a sliding window approach for time series prediction
- Implement cross-validation for model robustness
- Create separate modules for:
1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model training
4. Prediction generation
5. Visualization of results

Important constraints:
- Include clear disclaimers about prediction accuracy
- Do not provide direct investment advice
- Implement safeguards against overfitting
- Provide confidence intervals for predictions
- Log all model training and prediction attempts

Model Evaluation Criteria:
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared value
- Sharpe ratio comparison
- Backtesting performance

Please design a comprehensive AI-powered long term stock price prediction system in Python. The system should leverage machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices with high accuracy. Provide a complete project structure, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and prediction modules. Ensure the implementation is modular, well-documented, and includes robust error handling and performance evaluation mechanisms.
