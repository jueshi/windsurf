you can enable microphone playback (also called "mic monitoring") on my computer which is windows laptop. Here's how you can do it:

   - Select **"Sounds"** or **"Sound settings"** (depending on your version of Windows).

2. **Open the Recording Tab:**
   - If you opened **"Sounds"**, go to the **Recording** tab.
   - If you opened **"Sound settings"**, scroll down and click **"More sound settings"**, then navigate to the **Recording** tab.

3. **Select Your Microphone:**
   - In the **Recording** tab, find your microphone in the list of devices.

### **Notes:**
- **Latency:** There might be a slight delay (latency) between speaking and hearing your voice. This depends on your audio drivers and hardware.
- **Headphones Recommended:** To avoid feedback or echo, it’s best to use headphones instead of speakers when enabling mic playback.
- **Disable When Not Needed:** If you don’t need to hear your voice, disable this feature to avoid unnecessary distractions or feedback.
